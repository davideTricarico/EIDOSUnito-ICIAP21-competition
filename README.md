# EIDOSUnito-ICIAP21-competition
Code for distance based approach proposed by EIDOSUnito team and applied to ICIAP21 covid19 severity prediction challenge

In folder code you can find:
- train.py: the program to train a model. The resulting model will be saved into models folder
- test.py: the program to generate the predictions for test files. The resulting prediciton will be saved into predictions folder
- utils.py: contains supporting functions
- model.py: contains supporting functions for model training and definition

To run the code, create the required folders (check the code for the complete list) and modify the expected paths for training and testing sets.
